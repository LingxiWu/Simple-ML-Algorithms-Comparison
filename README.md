Comparative Algorithmic Study for Machine Learning

Design and construct a comparative algorithmic study using a set of learning algorithms

Perform feature selection on the data set to reduce the number of attributes used
Train and test the algorithms using the double resampling strategy (double crossvalidation.)
Display results in the form of tables and graphs, as well as a number of metrics
Compare and discuss results of your experiments
